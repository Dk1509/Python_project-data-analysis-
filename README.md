# # Predicting No-Show Appointments

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to predict whether a patient will show up for a medical appointment or not. This predictive model can help healthcare providers anticipate potential no-shows and take proactive measures.

## Steps in the Project

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**
   - Load the dataset using pandas, explore basic statistics, and identify any missing values.
   - Modify date and time columns into standard forms for analysis.
   - Extract weekdays for scheduled and appointment days.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Rename columns for consistency.
   - Drop columns with no significant impact on analysis.
   - Convert categorical variables into dummy variables.
   
3. **Data Visualization:**
   - Visualize the count of no-shows to understand the distribution.
   - Explore the distribution of various features in relation to the no-show variable.
   - Utilize seaborn and matplotlib for effective visualizations.

4. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Examine the correlation of all predictors with the target variable (No-Show).
   - Use heatmaps and bar plots to visualize the correlation.

5. **Bivariate Analysis:**
   - Conduct a detailed analysis of individual features against the target variable.
   - Utilize univariate plots for a deeper understanding of the relationships.

6. **Machine Learning Model:**
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Apply machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests to predict no-show appointments.

7. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the performance of the machine learning model using relevant metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   - Fine-tune the model for better results.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - Summarize key findings from the analysis.
   - Discuss the implications of the model for healthcare providers.
   - Highlight potential interventions based on the predictive insights.

## Key Tools and Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Machine Learning (scikit-learn)
- Data Visualization (seaborn, matplotlib)

## Findings
Female patients have taken more appointments then male patients
Ratio of Nohow and Show is almost equal for age group except Age 0 and Age 1 with 80% show rate for each age group
Each Neighbourhood have almost 80% show rate
There are 99666 patients without Scholarship and out of them around 80% have come for the visit and out of the 21801 patients with Scholarship around 75% of them have come for the visit.
there are around 88,726 patients without Hypertension and out of them around 78% have come for the visit and Out of the 21801 patients with Hypertension around 85% of them have come for the visit.
there are around 102,584 patients without Diabetes and out of them around 80% have come for the visit and Out of the 7,943 patients with Diabetes around 83% of them have come for the visit.
there are around 75,045 patients who have not received SMS and out of them around 84% have come for the visit and out of the 35,482 patients who have received SMS around 72% of them have come for the visit.
